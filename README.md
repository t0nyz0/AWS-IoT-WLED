# AWS-IoT-WLED

### [Detailed project information](https://t0nyz.com/projects/awsiot)

The project demonstrates controlling a WLED device in near real-time using AWS IoT and an ESP32 microcontroller. It showcases how an MQTT message sent from a website can trigger a color change in a WLED light via AWS IoT, with the ESP32 acting as a bridge between the cloud and the physical device.
